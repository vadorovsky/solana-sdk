    /// as a Solana `Address`, except they are ensured to not be on the ed25519
    /// curve and thus have no associated private key. When performing
    /// cross-program invocations the program can "sign" for the key by calling
    /// [`invoke_signed`] and passing the same seeds used to generate the
    /// address, along with the calculated _bump seed_, which this function
    /// returns as the second tuple element. The runtime will verify that the
    /// program associated with this address is the caller and thus authorized
    /// to be the signer.
    ///
    /// [`invoke_signed`]: https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/program/fn.invoke_signed.html
    ///
    /// The `seeds` are application-specific, and must be carefully selected to
    /// uniquely derive accounts per application requirements. It is common to
    /// use static strings and other addresses as seeds.
    ///
    /// Because the program address must not lie on the ed25519 curve, there may
    /// be seed and program id combinations that are invalid. For this reason,
    /// an extra seed (the bump seed) is calculated that results in a
    /// point off the curve. The bump seed must be passed as an additional seed
    /// when calling `invoke_signed`.
    ///
    /// The processes of finding a valid program address is by trial and error,
    /// and even though it is deterministic given a set of inputs it can take a
    /// variable amount of time to succeed across different inputs.  This means
    /// that when called from an on-chain program it may incur a variable amount
    /// of the program's compute budget.  Programs that are meant to be very
    /// performant may not want to use this function because it could take a
    /// considerable amount of time. Programs that are already at risk
    /// of exceeding their compute budget should call this with care since
    /// there is a chance that the program's budget may be occasionally
    /// and unpredictably exceeded.
    ///
    /// As all account addresses accessed by an on-chain Solana program must be
    /// explicitly passed to the program, it is typical for the PDAs to be
    /// derived in off-chain client programs, avoiding the compute cost of
    /// generating the address on-chain. The address may or may not then be
    /// verified by re-deriving it on-chain, depending on the requirements of
    /// the program. This verification may be performed without the overhead of
    /// re-searching for the bump key by using the [`create_program_address`]
    /// function.
    ///
    /// [`create_program_address`]: Address::create_program_address
    ///
    /// **Warning**: Because of the way the seeds are hashed there is a potential
    /// for program address collisions for the same program id.  The seeds are
    /// hashed sequentially which means that seeds {"abcdef"}, {"abc", "def"},
    /// and {"ab", "cd", "ef"} will all result in the same program address given
    /// the same program id. Since the chance of collision is local to a given
    /// program id, the developer of that program must take care to choose seeds
    /// that do not collide with each other. For seed schemes that are susceptible
    /// to this type of hash collision, a common remedy is to insert separators
    /// between seeds, e.g. transforming {"abc", "def"} into {"abc", "-", "def"}.
